# Core REST Services
![](https://github.com/gcarbone/core-rest-services/raw/main/public/ui/core-rest-services-logo-zip-file/png/logo-no-background.png)


## Description

Designed to be easily extensible, Core REST Services aims to provide a REST interface to common data center functions.  Many organizations continue to adopt next-gen iPaaS platforms to automate processes and remove manual "swivel-chair" data entry across multiple systems.  However, most organizations are still tied to some "legacy" systems that do not provide a modern way to access them.  This project (hopefully) will make it easier to include these systems in their process automation efforts.
